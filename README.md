This example contains 2 parts:  a client that generates random tokens, and a server that validates them.

Client:

To configure:  edit okta_config.json to listen on the port you would like
To install:  npm install
To start:  npm start

Server:

Located under the server directory

To install:  npm install
To start:  npm start

If you'd like to configure the port it listens on, edit server.js.

I already have an example token generator at http://portal.galvin.ninja:8081, if you want to use the same dictionary and just implement the server.
